# Attendance System v2.0.3 🚀

A state-of-the-art facial recognition attendance system designed for high accuracy and adaptability. Built with **FastAPI** (Backend) and **React** (Frontend).

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. High-Precision Recognition (InsightFace) 👁️
- **InsightFace Only**: Optimized pipeline using InsightFace's `buffalo_l` model for detection, alignment, and recognition.
- **Lightweight Liveness**: Texture-based liveness detection (sharpness/color analysis) replaces heavy mesh-based checks.
- **Performance**: 3-5x faster detection and significantly lower CPU usage compared to previous versions.

### 2. Adaptive Training System 🧠
- **Self-Learning**: The system automatically updates employee profiles when appearance changes (e.g., beard growth, aging).
- **Stability Check**: Updates only trigger after **3 consecutive high-confidence recognitions** (>90%).
- **Weighted Updates**: Uses a rolling average to gradually evolve the biometric profile without losing the original identity.

### 3. Optimized RTSP Streaming 📹 (Optimized in v2.0.2)
- **MJPEG Endpoint**: Dedicated `/api/stream/{camera_id}` for bandwidth-efficient streaming.
- **Optimized Performance**: 640x360 @ 15 FPS with 75% JPEG quality for smooth playback.
- **CPU Optimized**: 2.5 FPS detection rate for 60-70% CPU reduction.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: VAAPI support for Intel/AMD GPUs (60-80% faster video decoding).
- **Low Latency**: ~150-300ms delay for real-time monitoring.
- **H.265 Support**: Compatible with H.265/HEVC camera streams for better compression.

### 4. Enterprise-Grade Attendance ⏱️
- **Strict Time Constraints**: Configurable windows for ENTRY (03:00-13:30) and EXIT (12:00-23:59).
- **Smart Auth**: Secure WAN access with PIN protection, seamless LAN access.
- **Reporting**: Export attendance logs to Excel/CSV.
- **Auto-Logging**: Automatic attendance recording during live video streaming (v2.0.3).
